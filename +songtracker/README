Description
-----------
This Chrome extension writes songs you are listening to on Google Play Music into your Google+ History.

Disclaimer
----------
The Google+ History API is still in developer preview so this extension might stop working without notice.

Requirements/Installation
-------------------------
1) Sign-up for the Google+ History developer preview: https://developers.google.com/+/history/preview/

2) OAuth Tokens at Google API Console https://code.google.com/apis/console/

  Create a new project.

  Activate the Google+ API and Google+ History API in Services

  Create OAuth2 Tokens in "API Access"

  Add http://www.google.com/robots.txt as Redirect URI

  Edit tracker_background.js to set <YOUR_CLIENT_ID> and <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET> accordingly.

3) Server-side script
  The Google+ API needs public URLs for whatever you want to write to History.
  Since Google Play Music doesn't offer public URLs for song-info I created a small php script.
  This script takes the song info as parameters and creates the necessary page with schema.org markup.
  You can host the script on your own server if you want (replacing the URL in tracker_background.js)
  or use the script that I hosted if you want (URL might change).

4) Once everything is set-up you can load the extension as unpacked extension in Chrome.
  Enable Developer at mode chrome://chrome/extensions/
  "Load unpacked extension" and point it to extension folder.


Usage
-----
You will get a new icon in your browser bar.
Clicking it will show a pop-up which at first will only show "Authorize"
Clicking the first time will redirect you through the Google OAuth flow where you have to give permission to the extension.
Once authorized (you might have to click Authorize twice on first use) you can click on "Start tracking"
While playing music on Google Play Music https://play.google.com/music/ the song information will be send to your Google+ History at https://plus.google.com/history
