=Description=

This script while read your public Google+ posts and display them similar to the FB timeline. This was done more as a proof-of-concept than being meant for actual use, but people seemed to like it, so I've uploaded the source here.

You can see a live example here: http://www.allmyplus.com/timeline/

New posts will be loaded when you scroll to the bottom of the page, theoretically allowing access to all public posts you ever made.

=Installation & Usage=

First download everything into one folder, there's a package with everything in [http://code.google.com/p/gplus-timeline/downloads/list Downloads].

Then you will need a Google API Key to be able to run this script:

  * Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/
  * Create a new project.
  * Activate the Google+ API in Services
  * Go to API-Access and copy your API key.
  * Edit index.html and replace {YOUR API KEY} with your key.
  * Also replace {YOUR PROFILE ID} with your Google profile ID (the long number)

After that you can simply open index.html locally in your browser, or upload it to your website if you want other people to see it as well.
