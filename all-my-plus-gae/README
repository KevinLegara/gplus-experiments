=Description=
This script will read the Google+ activities for one user and display various statistics as well as a full list of recent posts.

You can check out a running version here:
https://allmyplus.appspot.com/

=Disclaimer=
The code is just hacked together quickly and not really optimised or cleaned-up yet.

=Requirements=
1) Google JS-API Key
  Sign up for an API Key for using the Google JS-API loader http://code.google.com/apis/loader/

  Edit settings.py to set JSAPI_KEY accordingly.

2) OAuth Tokens and Application Key at Google API Console
  https://code.google.com/apis/console/

  Create a new project.

  Activate the Google+ API in Services

  Create OAuth2 Tokens in "API Access"

  If you want to run this locally via the Google App Engine Launcher you can use
  http://localhost:8090/oauth2callback (or whatever port you have configured) as Redirect URI.

  If you deploy it to Google App Engine you will have to use your appspot URL like
  https://myapp.appspot.com/oauth2callback
  In this case you will also have to edit app.yaml to change application from "allmyplus" to your app name.

  Adjust settings in Quotas as necessary.

  Edit settings.py to set CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and API_KEY accordingly.
