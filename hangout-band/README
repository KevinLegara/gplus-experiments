=Description=

This app allows you to play several different instruments together with other participants of a Google+ Hangout.

You can test the app by starting a hangout from here http://www.allmyplus.com/hangout-band/ or play with the stand-alone version http://www.allmyplus.com/hangout-band/app.html


=Installation=

  * Edit band.xml, band.css and band.js and replace all instances of <YOUR PATH> with the URL where you plan to upload the files (including a / at the end).

  * Upload all the files to <YOUR PATH>

  * Please note that the files need to be publicly accessible.

  * .htaccess makes sure that the sound files can be accessed via CORS. You can also set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin *` header in another way depending on your server.

  * Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/ and create a new project.

  * Activate the "Google+ Hangouts API" in Services.

  * Go to "Hangouts" and put the full URL to <YOUR PATH>band.xml in "Gadget URL"

  * Save and you are ready to "Enter a hangout!" :)

If you want to test this with other people you will have to add them as Team members in the API console, and then send them the URL of the hangout you just started.

You can also test this yourself by joining the same hangout via the URL from another PC.

If you extend this script with any fun or interesting features I'd be happy to hear about them, just contact me via Google+ here https://plus.google.com/112336147904981294875 :)
