Description:
------------
This script will display what people interact with you the most.

Disclaimer:
------------
The code is just hacked together quickly and not really optimised or cleaned-up yet.

Please note that running the script with max values will take a while to complete and also need 301 queries of your API quota at worst case.

"Installation":
---------------

You will need a Google API Key to be able to run this script:
  Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/
  Create a new project.
  Activate the Google+ API in Services
  Replace {API_KEY} with your key.
  
You will also need to replace {USER_ID} with your Google ID, which is the long number you see in the URL when you visit your profile.

You can make adjustments to the variables as needed.

After those changes you can run the script locally simply by opening the index.html in your browser.

What happens:
-------------

The script will start by getting 100 (defined in MAX_ACTIVITIES) of your recent public activities.
It will then for each of these activities retrieve 100 (defined in MAX_COMMENTS/MAX_RESHARES/MAX_PLUSONES) comments/resharers/plusoners and for each of the people that appear start counting the number of activities.

For each person a score is calculated as a weighted sum of comments, reshares and plusones (weights can be defined in SCORE_COMMENTS/SCORE_RESHARES/SCORE_PLUSONES).

Example with standard parameters:
  3 comments, 2 reshares and 4 +1's of a person will give this person a score of 3*3+2*2+4*1 = 17.
  The script will display this as "17 / C:3 R:2 P:4"
  
Based on this score the people are displayed, the higher the score, the closer they are to you.
For people with the same score, the ones who interacted more recently will be on top.
