=Description=

This script does two different things to give you an idea of the influence of your Google+ posts.

==index.html==

The *index.html* lists all public Google+ activities which can be reached via the API and present them in a list which is sortable by number of comments/reshares/+1's.

==analyser.html==

The *analyser.html* (which is linked for each post in index.html) tries to evaluate the effects of one of your posts.

It first fetches a bunch of people who interacted with your posts via comments/reshares/+1's.

It then reads the activities of those people around the date of your post, taking posts in a defined range before and after your post.

The following values are listed:
  * Number of Posts
  * Number of Photos
  * Number of comments on the posts
  * Number of reshares of the posts
  * Number of +1's for the posts

For each of thes you get:
  * The total number
  * A per-post ratio which simply is value diveded by number of posts

The values are further split as follows.
  * Total - for all posts
  * Original - posts you have created yourself
  * Reshares - posts you have reshared from others

And then the value is split according to the date of your post, into activities that happened before you posted and activities that happened afterwards.


=Installation & Usage=

First download everything into one local folder.

Then you will need a Google API Key to be able to run this script:

  * Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/
  * Create a new project.
  * Activate the Google+ API in Services
  * Go to API-Access and copy your API key.
  * Open config.js and replace {API_KEY} with your key.
  * In config.js you can also define how many days before and after your post you want to consider for the analyser.

After that you can open index.html in your browser, input your Google+ ID (which is the long number in your profile URL) and fetch your posts.

Each post has a link to the analyser which will open in a new tab.

You can copy the resulting table into a spreadsheet application of your choice for further analysis.
